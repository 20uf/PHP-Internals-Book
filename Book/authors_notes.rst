PHP Book Domains
================

Those domains have been bought by Anthony to publish info about the book :

* phpinternalsbook.com
* phpcorebook.com
* insidephpbook.com

The idea is to publish the TOC and some preview chapters publicly throught those
domains, that way people can follow the progress and stay interested in the
project.
