Introduction
============

This book is a collaborative effort between several PHP developers to better document and describe how PHP works internally.

Primary Goals
-------------

There are three primary goals of this book:

1. Document and describe how PHP internals work.
2. Document and describe how to extend the language with extensions.
3. Document and describe how you can interact with the community to develop PHP itself.


Target Audience
---------------

This book intends to be targeted at primarlly developers who have experience in the C programming language. However, where-ever possible we will attempt to distil the information and summarize it so that developers who don't know C will still be able to understand the content.

Work In Progress
----------------

As this book is a work-in-progress, any feedback is *greatly* appreciated! Please send any feedback to: feedback@phpinternalsbook.com.
