Introduction
============

This book is a collaborative effort between several PHP developers to better document and describe how PHP works
internally.

There are three primary goals of this book:

 * Document and describe how PHP internals work.
 * Document and describe how to extend the language with extensions.
 * Document and describe how you can interact with the community to develop PHP itself.

This book is primarily targeted at developers who have experience in the C programming language. However, where-ever
possible we will attempt to distill the information and summarize it so that developers who don't know C will still be
able to understand the content.

As this book is a work-in-progress, any feedback is *greatly* appreciated! Please send any feedback to:
